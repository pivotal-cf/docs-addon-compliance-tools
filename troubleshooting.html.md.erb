## <a id='scan-results'></a> scan_results Issues
### <a id='scan-exitcode-1'></a> scan_results Completed with Error (Exit Code 1)

#### Symptom
Running a scan results in an `exit code 1` error similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
...
Instance   oscap_store/43aba653-4d0a-4cfc-bc72-a136ce33e3e0
Exit Code  1
Stdout     2019/07/05 21:11:04 Starting store on port 28894

           Received no scan results

Stderr     -

1 errand(s)
Errand 'scan_results' completed with error (exit code 1)
Exit code 1
</pre>

#### Explanation
Your certificates have expired.

#### Solution
Rotate your certificates. For instructions, see
[Rotating Certificates](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-api-cert-rotation.html).

### <a id='scan-exitcode-124'></a> scan_results Received Signal Terminated (Exit Code 124)

#### Symptom
Running a scan results in an `exit code 124` error similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
...
Instance   oscap_store/43aba653-4d0a-4cfc-bc72-a136ce33e3e0
Exit Code  124
Stdout    2019/06/24 15:43:30 Starting store on port 28894
          2019/06/24 15:43:30 [10.0.8.5] &lt;nil&gt;<br>
          2019/06/24 15:43:30 Starting scan on 10.0.8.5
          2019/06/24 15:43:31 Received signal terminated
          Scanner timed out, did not receive all the scan results in 1200 second(s)
</pre>

#### Explanation
Your scan has reached the configured timeout period.
This may occur if a VM lacks sufficient memory or CPU to finish its scan in time.

#### Solution

Do one of the following:

* Increase the scan timeout for all VMs. For more information, see
**Scanner Timeout** under [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scans).

* Increase the memory or CPU resources for any failing scanned VMs.

### <a id='scan-vm-noresults'></a> scan_results Does Not Include Scans for VMs in the Deployment

#### Symptom
Only scan results for the `oscap_store` VM are being generated.
VMs in the deployment are not being scanned.

#### Explanation
<%= vars.product_short %> is a BOSH add-on, as well as a tile.
When a scan is run, the `oscap_store` VM verifies each VM's OSCAP release version.
Because of this, the latest OSCAP release must be deployed on all VMs to function properly.

#### Solution
When installing or upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, you must **Apply Changes**
on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> (and any other tiles with VMs you want to scan) after applying changes
to the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
This is so that the version of <%= vars.product_short %> on the VMs match the version
being used by the scanner.

### <a id='scan-vm-cannot-resolve'></a> Unable to resolve store domain: no such host

#### Symptom
Running a scan results in an `exit code 1` error similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
...
Instance   oscap_store/43aba653-4d0a-4cfc-bc72-a136ce33e3e0

</pre>

and produces a `scanner_web_ctl.log` similar to the following:

**/var/vcap/sys/log/config\_scanner/scanner\_web\_ctl.log:**

<pre class="terminal">
2019/08/05 10:21:34 Lookup store
2019/08/05 10:21:34 Unable to resolve store domain: lookup q-s4.oscap-store.NETWORK-NAME.p-compliance-scanner-5f51f48abb5fbf23b617.bosh on 169.254.0.2:53: no such host
</pre>

Where `NETWORK-NAME` is the name given to the network being used for the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

#### Explanation
BOSH DNS cannot resolve the `oscap_store` VM URL if there is any capitalization in the network's **Name**.

#### Solution
Verify that the network you selected inside the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane
of your <%= vars.product_short %> tile is not capitalized.

If this is the case, you must edit the name of the network being used to remove the capitalization:

1. On the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, click **BOSH Director**.
2. Click **Create Networks**.
3. Change the network **Name** to a name without capital letters, and click **Save**.
4. Click **Review Pending Changes**, and then click **Apply Changes** to all tiles.

This updates the network name property on all VMs.

### <a id='scan-memory-timeout'></a> oscap_store receives ReportFailed (Exit code 1)

#### Symptom
Running a scan results in an `exit code 1` error similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">

          2020/03/12 16:51:36 Shutdown
          Scanner exited with 1 code
</pre>

#### Explanation
The `oscap_store` receives a `ReportFailed` event from one of the VMs being scanned.
The error message `10.0.0.11:59566 failed: Error from daemon: exit status 124`
indicates that the scan timed out on that particular VM.

This can happen if a timeout increase was only applied to the `oscap_store` VM.

#### Solution

Increase the scan timeout for all VMs. For more information, see
[Scanner Timeout](./installing.html#scanner-timeout).

### <a id='post-errors'></a> Scan Successful with POST Errors

This problem with POST errors only applies to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.2.32 and earlier.
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.2.48 and later does not try to scan Windows VMs and
any Linux VMs where <%= vars.product_short %> is not deployed.

#### Symptom
Linux VMs without <%= vars.product_short %> and all Windows VMs show `POST` errors during a successful scan.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
...
Instance   oscap_store/bcb225db-f29f-4356-9d6a-525cbc99f6e1
Exit Code  0
Stdout    2020-05-13 14:02:42 Starting scan

</pre>

#### Explanation
Scan results include errors for VMs that <%= vars.product_short %> has skipped:

* **For Windows VMs:**<br>
  `net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)`
* **For Linux VMs without <%= vars.product_short %> installed and running:**<br>
  `dial tcp 10.0.4.5:28893: connect: connection refused`

The above errors do not prevent the remainder of the scans from being completed.

#### Solution
There are a few situations to consider:

* **If the hosts that provide the errors are Windows VMs:**<br>
  This is the expected behavior. <%= vars.product_short %> does not currently support Windows.

* **If the hosts that provide the errors are VMs that you expect to have <%= vars.product_short %> installed and running:**<br>
  Perform an "Apply Changes" on the deployment and the <%= vars.product_full %>
  tile to ensure that the VMs have the <%= vars.product_short %> installed and running.

    To verify that <%= vars.product_short %> is installed and running, you can run `bosh instances --ps`.
    Ensure that each VM shows that the `scanner_daemon` and `scanner_web` processes are in a `running` state.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh instances --ps<br>
    Instance                                          Process               Process State  AZ          IPs       Deployment
