1. Configure the remaining fields:<a name='configure-remaining-fields'></a>

    <table class="nice">
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>

        <tr><a name="scanner-timeout"></a><td><strong>Scanner Timeout</strong></td>

        </tr>

        <tr><td><strong>CPU Limit</strong></td>
            <td>Set the percentage of CPU that the <%= vars.product_short %> processes can use.
                Integers from <code>1</code> to <code>100</code> are valid.<br>
                Setting this field to <code>100</code> permits the use of one full core.

                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
                <strong>CPU Limit</strong> affects only one core.
                 For example, in a system with four cores, if you set the CPU limit to <code>100</code>,
                 <%= vars.product_short %> uses only one of the four cores.
                 </p>
             </td>
        </tr>

        <tr><td><strong>Enforce CPU Limit</strong></td>

      </tr>
       <tr><a name="include-deployment"></a>
        <td><strong>List of deployments to scan. (Leave empty to scan all deployments)</strong></td>
        <td>(Optional) Enter the deployments that you want <%= vars.product_short %> to scan.

            If empty, <%= vars.product_short %> scans all deployments.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='scheduled-scan'></a> Configure Scheduled Scan
<%= vars.product_short %> can be configured to run a scan at a scheduled time and day of the week.
<br>The default values are `"00:00"` and `Sunday`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
VMware recommends setting up external storage to store the scan result reports.
If you do not do this, <%= vars.product_short %> will overwrite your previous local reports.
For more information on setting up external storage, see
<a href="#external-store">(Optional) Configure External Store Upload</a> below.
</p>

To change the scheduled scan values:

1. Select **Scheduled Scans**.

    ![Screenshot of the Scheduled Scans Configuration pane in the Compliance Scanner tile. All fields and settings are described in order in the steps below.](images/scheduled-scans.png)

1. Select **Enable**.
1. Set the **Scheduled scan start time** value.
  The **Scheduled scan start time** must be in 24-hour format `HH:MM`.
1. Select a **Scheduled scan day**.
  Only one value may be selected.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="external-store"></a> (Optional) Configure External Store Upload
To store scan results in an Amazon S3 bucket, a Minio S3-compatible bucket, or an Azure Blob Storage Container,
configure an external store upload.

If you configure an external store, then <%= vars.product_short %> uploads scan
results to that store.
This means that auditors do not need access to <%= vars.ops_manager %> to download BOSH logs
or rely on the operator to give them scan results.
Additionally, when using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system,
automating the consumption of the scan results is easier and does not require
access to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API.

If you do not use an external store for scan results, then the scan results are stored in the `oscap_store` VM.
For more information, see [Retrieve Log Files](./using.html#review-tile).

### <a id="s3-bucket"></a>Configure to Upload to an S3 Bucket

There are two ways that you can give <%= vars.product_short %> access to an Amazon S3 bucket:

+ **Using Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:** This is the easier method.
  If you have the access key ID and the secret access key, enter them in the fields.

+ **Using an instance profile for the S3 bucket:** If you do not have the access key ID and the secret access key
  but you do have the name of an instance profile for the S3 bucket,
  then you can use the `om` command-line interface (CLI)
  to give <%= vars.product_short %> the name of the instance profile for the S3 bucket.

#### To configure an external store upload using an S3 bucket:

1. Select **External Store Upload**.
1. Select **AWS S3 Bucket**.

      ![Screenshot of the External Store Upload pane in the Compliance Scanner tile. The AWS S3 Bucket radio button is selected, which reveals configuration fields for the AWS S3 Bucket. All fields and settings are described in order in the step below.](images/bucket-aws.png)

3. Configure the fields:

    <table class="nice">
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Bucket Name</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the name of the S3 bucket.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Bucket Region</strong></td>
        <td>Select the region that the S3 bucket was created in.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Access Key ID</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the access key ID for AWS credentials with access to the S3 bucket. <br>
          VMware recommends that you ensure the credentials permit write access to just this S3 bucket.<br>
          If you do not have this key, click <strong>Save</strong>
          and follow the steps in <a href="#instance-profile">To
          use an instance profile to configure the S3 bucket</a> below.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Secret Access Key</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the access key secret for AWS credentials with access to the S3 bucket. <br>
          VMware recommends that you ensure the credentials permit write access to just this S3 bucket.<br>
          If you do not have this key, click <strong>Save</strong>
          and follow the steps in <a href="#instance-profile">To
          use an instance profile to configure the S3 bucket</a> below.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

6. Click **Save**.


#### <a name="instance-profile"></a>To use an instance profile to configure the S3 bucket:

For security reasons, you might not have the keys for the S3 bucket.
However, if you have the instance profile name for the S3 bucket, you can use the following steps.
You need the `om` CLI to do these steps.
For introductory information about the `om` CLI,
see [<%= vars.ops_manager %> CLI (om)](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/ops-man-api-cli.html).


1. On the command line, run:

    ```
     om configure-director --config <(echo "
     vmextensions-configuration:
     - name: s3_instance_profile
          cloud_properties:
            iam_instance_profile: INSTANCE-PROFILE
    ")
    ```

    Where is `INSTANCE-PROFILE` is the name of the instance profile for the S3 bucket.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ om configure-director --config <(echo "
    vmextensions-configuration:
    &#8208; name: s3_instance_profile
      cloud_properties:
        iam_instance_profile: scan_store_bucket
    ")
    started configuring vm extensions
    applying vmextensions configuration for the following:
      s3_instance_profile
    finished configuring vm extensions

      </pre>

1. Run:

    ```
     om configure-product --config <( echo "
     product-name: p-compliance-scanner
     resource-config:
          oscap_store:
            additional_vm_extensions:
            - s3_instance_profile
    ")
    ```

    Example output:

    <pre class="terminal">
    configuring product...
    network properties are not provided, nothing to do here
    product properties are not provided, nothing to do here
    applying resource configuration for the following jobs:
