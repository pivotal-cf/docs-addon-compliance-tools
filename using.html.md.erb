<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use Compliance Scanner for PCF.

<%= vars.product_short %> performs one errand that starts scanning.
When this errand is triggered, it starts the scanning errand on each VM, including the `oscap_store`
VM that the tile creates.

The scanning errand is set to `Off` by default. This is because <%= vars.product_short %> only scans
tiles that are already present when you deploy it.
If you install other tiles during the same time <%= vars.product_short %> is installed,
the additional tiles are not scanned.

The scan errand on each VM does generate the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
tests each time by running XGen on XFiles.


##<a id='scan-methods'></a> Ways to Scan VMs

You can scan VMs using the tile UI or the command line:

* When performing an audit, see [Scan Using the <%= vars.product_short %> Tile](#tile-scan).
* When setting up automated scans of your VMs, see [Scan Using the Command Line](#terminal-scan).


##<a id='tile-scan'></a> Scan Using the <%= vars.product_short %> Tile
Scanning VMs involves three procedures:

1. [Scan the VMs](#scan-vms)
1. [Retrieve Log Files](#review-tile)
1. [Find Scan Output](#scan-output)

###<a id='scan-vms'></a> Scan the VMs

To begin scanning, do the following:

1. Confirm that your scan is configured correctly with the benchmarks and log formats you want output.

    For more information on configuring your scan,
    see [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager_full %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **REVIEW PENDING CHANGES**.

1. Enable the checkboxes for the <%= vars.product_short %> tile and the **Run config scans on PAS** errand.

    ![Review pending changes page with Compliance Scanner for PCF selected and Run config scans on PAS errand selected](images/review-pending-changes.png)

    A scan is triggered at the end.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> If there are configuration changes
      from add-ons or tiles other than <%= vars.product_short %>, leave those
      products' and errands' checkboxes enabled if you want those changes to be applied.
     If there are no changes from other sources, only the <%= vars.product_short %>
     tile needs to have its checkbox enabled.
   </p>

1. Click **APPLY CHANGES**.

    When scanning is finished, a second errand is triggered by the `Run-config-scans-on-PAS` errand
    to retrieve the logs from each VM.
    On each VM, there is only one log file per format and one ZIP log file at a time.
    If you run any subsequent scans these files are overwritten.

###<a id='review-tile'></a>Retrieve Log Files

To review the logs for a completed scan using the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, do the following:

1. When the changes have been applied, return to the Installation Dashboard
   and click the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

    ![dialog at the end of apply changes](images/changes-applied.png)

1. Click the **Status** tab and download the `oscap_store` log file.

    This downloads the log file containing scan results from the `oscap_store` VM to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
    If you select the download icon multiple times, a list of ZIP files is created in <%= vars.ops_manager %>,
    each with a different timestamp.

1. Click the **Logs** tab and click on the filename of the ZIP log file.

    This downloads the scan results from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> to your local machine.

	![The logs pane from where the zipped scan logs can be downloaded](images/download-logs.png)

    The timestamp indicates when the scan was initiated.

1. Decompress the downloaded file.

    The contents of the downloaded file depend on the formats and benchmarks you selected during
    configuration.
    For example, a report in HTML format from the Base Xenial benchmark, might look like this.

    ![HTML report header](images/sample-html-output.png)


    <a href="base_xenial_sample.html" target="_blank">See a larger version of this image.</a>

###<a id='scan-output'></a> Find Scan Output

The `oscap_store` ZIP file contains scan results from the `oscap_store` VM.
<br>
The results of the scan are at the following path:

  ```
  oscap_store/scanner/scan_results/output
  ```

  The naming syntax for each log file is the following:

  ```
  BENCHMARK_COMPONENT_UUID.FORMAT
  ```
  Where:

  + `BENCHMARK` is the benchmark that was used for the scan.
  + `COMPONENT` is the VM that was scanned.
  + `UUID` is the UUID for the VM that was scanned.
  + `FORMAT` is the format of the file and is one of the formats that you configured
  in [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).

  For example, the `oscap_store` folder directory looks similar to the following image:

  ![oscap_store file structure](images/oscap_store.png)

<!-- If you need to edit the above image you need to edit the corresponding
oscap_store.html file in draw.io and then export the image to a png file. -->

The number of log files in the `output` directory can be calculated as follows:

  ```
  (v + i) * f * b
  ```
  Where:

  + `v` is the number of VMs in your PCF deployment.
  + `i` is the number of additional instances for any VM in your PCF deployment.
  + `f` is the number of formats you configured in [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).
  + `b` is the number of benchmarks you configured in [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).


##<a id='terminal-scan'></a>Scan Using the Command Line

You also have the option of scanning VMs using the command line.
There are two ways to do this:

* [Scan and Retrieve Log Files](#scan-retrieve-logs)
* [Retrieve Existing Log Files](#retrieve-only-logs)


###<a id='scan-retrieve-logs'></a>Scan and Retrieve Log Files

To start a new scan and retrieve the logs for the completed scan using the command line, do the following:

1. Log in to the BOSH Director.
    1. On the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, create an alias in the BOSH CLI for your BOSH Director IP address. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh alias-env my-env -e 10.0.0.3</pre>
    1. Log in to the BOSH Director, specifying the newly created alias.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env log-in</pre>
1. Run `bosh deployments` to list all the deployment names.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">

                              kubo/0.21.13
  </pre>

1. Find the `scanner` deployment in the list.
  It appears as `scanner-DEPLOYMENT-UUID`, where `DEPLOYMENT-UUID` is the UUID of your deployment.
1. Run the following command to start the scan and download the logs:

  ```
  bosh -e my-env -d scanner-DEPLOYMENT-UUID run-errand scan_results --download-logs --logs-dir PATH-TO-SAVE-SCAN-RESULTS
  ```

  Where:

  * `scanner-DEPLOYMENT-UUID` is the name of your scanner deployment.
  * `PATH-TO-SAVE-SCAN-RESULTS` is the directory in which you would like to save your logs to.
  You may omit `--logs-dir PATH-TO-SAVE-SCAN-RESULTS` if you want the logs to be saved to your current directory.

  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">bosh -e my-env -d scanner-f9822a33c2e0d04cb run-errand scan_results --download-logs --logs-dir scanner/logs/20190131</pre>

  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  The files generated use the most recent configuration of your tile.
  To see what the current settings are, see <a href="./installing.html#scan">Configure Scans</a>.</p>


###<a id='retrieve-only-logs'></a>Retrieve Existing Log Files

To retrieve existing logs for the most recent completed scan using the command line,
use the following command:

  ```
  bosh -e my-env -d scanner-DEPLOYMENT-UUID logs --only=scan_results --dir PATH-TO-SAVE-SCAN-RESULTS
  ```
  Where:

  * `scanner-DEPLOYMENT-UUID` is the name of your scanner deployment.
  * `PATH-TO-SAVE-SCAN-RESULTS` is the directory in which you would like to save your logs to.
  You may omit `--dir PATH-TO-SAVE-SCAN-RESULTS` if you want the logs to be saved to your current directory.

  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">bosh -e my-env -d scanner-f9822a33c2e0d04cb logs --only=scan_results --dir scanner/logs/20190131</pre>


###<a id='access-logs'></a>Access Log Files
To access your saved logs, unzip the output ZIP file.

The naming syntax for each log file is the following:

  ```
  BENCHMARK_COMPONENT_UUID.FORMAT
  ```
  Where:

  * `BENCHMARK` is the benchmark that was used for the scan.
  * `COMPONENT` is the VM that was scanned.
  * `UUID` is the UUID for the VM that was scanned.
  * `FORMAT` is the format of the file and is one of the formats that you configured
  in [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).

  For example, the `output` folder directory looks similar to the following image:

  ![output folder structure](images/command_line_output.png)


<!-- Put below "View Tests on VMs" section in a "Reporting" page in the future -->
##<a id='tests'></a> View Tests on VMs

For every configuration rule that is checked, there is a corresponding test written in YAML test
files residing on each VM.
You can use these files as reference for internal test development or to validate that the test
matches the description.

<!-- In the beta release of <%= vars.product_short %>,
you cannot write your own YAML tests or convert these tests to the SCAP format. -->

To view tests on VMS, do the following:

1. Use the BOSH CLI to SSH into a component VM. For more information,
see [BOSH SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh).
1. Navigate to the following path:

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/oscap/xfiles
    ```

1. Search for the test ID and open the corresponding file.
