**Release Date:** July 8, 2019

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* <%= vars.product_short %> now uses a client-server architecture for

      through the implementation of mutual TLS (mTLS).
    * Removes credentials needed to trigger scans from the `oscap_store` VM.
    * Now uses <%= vars.ops_manager %> Root CA certificate to sign the mTLS certificates.

* Adds a configurable **Scanner Timeout** field to limit how long a scan takes.
For how to configure this field, see [Configure Scans](./installing.html#scan).

### Resolved Issue
This release fixes the following issue:

* <%= vars.product_short %> is now compatible with foundations using federated
 Single Sign-On (SSO) and authorization.
